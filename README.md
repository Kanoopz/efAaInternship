# Technical Explainer - Software Engineering Intern for Account Abstraction
Dear AA team:
My name is Carlos Arroyo, and I am excited to apply for the Software Engineering Intern position, focusing on Account Abstraction. I graduated as a software engineer 5 months ago and have been developing smart contracts for over 4 years. Through my participation in hackathons across the globe, I have improved my skills and evolved into a full stack dApp developer with a strong focus on two key areas within the blockchain industry: cross chain technology and account abstraction.
In this essay, I aim to share my experiences, elaborate on the importance of account abstraction for the ecosystem, and present my ideas to enhance its adoption.

Account Abstraction (AA) addresses one of the most pressing challenges in blockchain; enhancing user experience (UX). By eliminating friction in key management, gas understanding and transaction signing, AA sets the way for a more user friendly and inclusive ecosystem.
A critical advantage of AA is its open implementation (currently), allowing diverse methods for user authentication. Examples include passkeys, Trusted Execution Environments (TEE), and biometrics. The introduction of ERC4337, the main AA standard, achieved this without altering Ethereum's protocol level. This was a significant challenge, requiring innovative solutions such as the bundler that is a special kind of node and a dedicated mempool architecture to manage UserOps transactions, which differ from standard transactions of the EOAs that have 3 simple fields: to, value and data.
The bundler's role is to aggregate and validate these UserOps, ensuring correctness, particularly for the paymaster: a smart contract that sponsors transaction fees. Once verified, the bundler batches these operations into a single transaction directed to the EntryPoint contract, which orchestrates function calls and state transitions across contracts.

My interaction with Account Abstraction began soon after OpenZeppelin completed the audit for ERC4337, requested by the Ethereum Foundation. During ETHDenver 2023, I developed a simple yet innovative idea: using the Google 2FA app for user authentication onchain in SmartAccounts. This approach aimed to combine familiarity with enhanced security.
Later, at ETHWaterloo, I explored another dimension of AA by creating a password based authentication mechanism combined with an onchain nonce. While functional, I identified a vulnerability to front running attacks. To address this, I incorporated Zero-Knowledge (ZK) proofs to introduce privacy and prevent such exploits.
At ETHNewYork, I took this further by conceptualizing a unified SmartAccount leveraging cross chain technology. This solution abstracted chain interactions, enabling users to create a single account on any EVM compatible chain and seamlessly interact across networks via a CrossChainEntryPoint. If no "linked smart account" existed on the destination chain, the CrossChainEntryPoint would create one dynamically and execute the intended UserOp. This innovation could achieve the groundwork for an EVM unified smart wallet.
Building on these experiences, my latest approach leverages voice biometrics and AI to revolutionize user onboarding by making it more intuitive and secure. This innovative solution employs voice authentication alongside ZK to guarantee privacy and protect biometrics. The offchain AI process dynamically generates transaction payloads by analyzing typical smart contract interactions, such as transferring ERC20 tokens, swapping assets, or listing ERC721 tokens on marketplaces.
The workflow is as follows: a large language model interprets user voice commands, translates them into precise data payloads for low level transaction calls, constructs the transaction data, prompts the user for voice biometric authentication, and ultimately submits the build transaction to the blockchain. This streamlined approach not only reduces friction in user interactions but also enhances accessibility for a wider audience that doesn't require advanced knowledge.

With this essay, I have detailed my understanding of Account Abstraction (ERC4337), shared my journey with it, and outlined innovative ideas to improve user onboarding and adoption. I am eager to join your team, collaborate with industry leading professionals, and contribute to making blockchain technology more accessible to everyone.
Thank you for considering my application. I look forward to the opportunity to learn, grow, and bring my passion for blockchain to the AA team.
Warm regards,
Carlos Arroyo
